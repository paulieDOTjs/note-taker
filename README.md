# Installation
All files should stay in original place, NPM init should be run, as well, as NPM install. Server.js should be the page that should be run using node after installation. 

# Usage
Can be used to keep track of notes. If done so on your local computer they will save indefinitely but there is no long-time storage on Heroku,

# Credits
Triology Education Services created the front end of the site, for my homework and practice on using express, heroku, and node. Credit to Jake O’Toole for the format of this readme.

# Challenges
The biggest challenge was finding the necessary tools to access the public directory, since it was something I had never dealt with before. Also, experienced an issue where items that had the ID 0 could not be viewed by JQUERY.
